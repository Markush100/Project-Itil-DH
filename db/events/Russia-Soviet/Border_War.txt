name = "The Uneasy Peace"
desc = "The 2nd Russo-Japanese war ended in an unsatisfying stalemate for both sides. The Soviets couldn't reclaim their lost territory, and the Japanese couldn't fulfill their strategic goals. The border separating the Russian State and the SDSR is in a state of constant skirmishing, with larger battles erupting from time to time. The situation is delicate, and a well timed offensive can be the difference between victory or annihilation."

name = "The Traitorous Menace"
desc = "The Russian State was formed when Kornilov and his White Hundreds gained Japanese support and invaded our far east. The buffer state has become a beacon of hope for delusional counterrevolutionaries seeking to undermine the world revolution. Once a larger border conflict erupts, we will have the chance to finally crush Japanese ambitions in our motherland, however marshal Triandafillov says the Eastern Army won't be prepared for an offensive this year."

name = "The Red Scourge"
desc = "The SDSR was unable to stop the heroic advance of our troops during the 2nd Russo-Japanese war. With the aid of Japan we liberated significant territory from the Soviets, and our industry is gaining foot after the massive influx of refugees from the Primorye and Europe. Currently we are in no state to fight the Soviets, however if they are involved in a war we could take the chance and deal the final blow for our Russian motherland."
